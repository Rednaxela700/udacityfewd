  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1. I’ve learned:
	a) basic text formating on sites, make it clear and easy to read for the visitors,
	b) to place html elements in correct order,
	c) that hyperlink can be more than just a few words referring to another site,
	d) the parent-child relation of elements in html document (I still have little 		difficulties with setting concrete relation in an article, but it’s much better 	than it was before).
	e) tree to html lesson was really insightful
	f) last and probably the most important thing (for me) is that I started to be 		more careful when I try to achieve certian result so… Thanks for mockups, I spent 	really brilliant time doing them!

2. Base html document syntax was very easy for me.

3. The first mockup was quite a challenge due to my bit chaotic nature and zoomed image which was quite hard to set in proper proportions. Luckily I’ve found help with ease on Slack.

4. I used mostly Mozilla Developer Network in time it becomes more easy for me to read the html elements documentation (I’ve never done it before). I’ve discovered also stackoverflow when I tried to position the picture in the first mockup using CSS. I’ve also set up my html notebook where I write down what I’ve learnt and some tips I find useful in the future.
